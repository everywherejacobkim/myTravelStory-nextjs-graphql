        content: 'The small hot spring village near Fukuoka, where I arrived at dawn, welcomed me with a quiet atmosphere and a snuggly morning fog. It felt like all the stress was gone. I found the onsen house I had reserved, and it was early in the morning, but I was super lucky that the owner of the onsen place opened the door and welcomed me. I sat alone in a quiet hot spring and enjoyed the silence of the peaceful hot spring village. '

        content: 'One fine day in September 2022, I traveled to Deep Cove and its surrounding area. It is home to some of the most spectacular and pristine wilderness in the Vancouver area, with mountains, forests, beaches, ocean, and wildlife galore. It would be awesome if you spend the day hiking scenic trails up to panoramic viewpoints or paddling a boat outside of the cove. I did hiking to one of the scenic viewpoints and enjoyed the natural, eco-friendly atmosphere and peaceful and mindful vibes.'

        content: 'I’m not a big fan of cities, but Madrid was almost love at first sight. Maybe because it was just the start of spring, or maybe because the city is just that beautiful! I spent most of my time by the River Manzanares in Madrid, strolling along the parks and squares of Madrid, exploring Madrid’s markets and cafes, and discovering its quirky neighborhoods. In this photo essay, I share a roundup of some of the best unusual things to see and do in Madrid, including local hangouts and relatively secret places, that are sure to make you fall in love with this Spanish city too.'
